# web-brutalizer

I am going to create a product that enables users to easily and quickly create brutalist
websites. All the user will need to do is supply any content they wish to share online in the
form of a brutalist website; whether they want to share a portfolio, music, an event, or even a
brand new product. Users will be able annotate content with a rudimentary coding system,
allowing them write out paragraph content, make lists, and add links. They will also be able
to submit image and video assets to include; they’ll be able to tie content to images as well if
necessary, giving greater context to some of content shown.

The trend of brutalist websites is getting bigger and bigger as days go by; it won’t be very
long until we start seeing elements from web brutalism in day to day websites and media. At
the the time of writing, there were over 300 submissions on the brutalist websites database.
Brutalist websites present an effective opposition to the lightness and optimism of today’s
web design, partially because they are built on principles of simplicity and ease of sharing.
Brutalist websites often harken back to a time in early internet culture where everyone had a
website that they were free to share whatever they wanted online with little to know technical
knowledge of HTML. In researching the medium, it was discovered that brutalist websites
are often not that simple. More frequently these websites use complex custom javascript,
CSS, and external fonts, that present a much greater learning curve for designers and
creative individuals
